I believe that I have accomplished all currently assigned parts of the assignment. I ran into hiccups along the way in that I was absent for the class where we setup part 0, but after reading the notes, I was able to catch up.

So far, I tested my interpreter with normal example cases that our assigned code would appear in. For example: echo "minus_one (S 0)" | cabal run LambdaNat-exe, which correctly generated the result: 0.

Through this assignment, I've been able to gain a better understanding of CFGs and the evalCBN and subst functions.
