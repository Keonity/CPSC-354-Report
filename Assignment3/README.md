I have struggled and failed to accomplish all parts of this assignment. I found great difficulty navigating LambdaFun and the error messages that it gave me. Several times, I ran into errors such as "non-exhaustive patterns in lambda" or "non-exhaustive patterns in function unify". They seem largely to relate to issues with pointers, but I wish they were more descriptive, because I found the debugging process to be really tedious and inefficient. 

Oddly enough, I also found difficulties with using what I thought were simple case statements. When evaluating a condition via a case statement, for example, `case (hd list > n)`, the interpreter gives me differing errors when I use `true` and `false` instead of  `True` or `False`. For example, using `True` and `False` results in the condition always being evaluated as `True`, and using `true` and `false` gives me a non-exhaustive patterns in lambda error. I wondered if this was an error, so I tried copying the base files for the assignnment again, but I still got the same error.
