I believe that I have accomplished all assigned parts of the assignment. I did run into many hiccups along the way. I struggled to find a good recursive formula for the functions: divN and modN, in the arithmetic.hs file. I ended up using some of my other own functions that were also present in the file and things seemed to work after that. I also struggled with  understanding how to edit the context-free grammar and Interpreter to work as the assignment asked, but I now realize that it's easier than I thought to work with them.

I also struggled with the deadline, but that was my own fault and I now realize that it wouldn't have been an issue at all if I had started on the assignment early as recommended by Prof. Kurz. Having now finished the assignment, I've come to the conclusion that the longest and hardest part was coming up with functions in part 1. I believe that if I worked on finding recursive functions more, I wouldn't have struggled as much as I did.

I tested my programs with the example test cases outlined in https://github.com/alexhkurz/programming-languages-2022/blob/main/assignment-1.md as well as coming up with some of my own test cases. My own test cases in part 1 at first largely tried to break the program(and along the way, it did succeed in some cases) by using large numbers. My own test cases in part 2 focused largely on exponentiation, negative, and parantheses because I believed that these expressions were most likely to break the program. I also made simpler test cases in part 2 for other expressions, like "Minus.". An example test case for that is "print $ eval(Minus (Num 2) (Num 3))".

Through this assignment, I've learned that CFGs(or at least the one in this assignment) aren't as complex as I thought they were. I also believe I learned a little more on ways to implement functions recursively, although this is still an area of growth for me. Some things I found interesting were how in Haskell, the / operator is used for mainly fractional integers as well as how I could use the abstract syntax generated with the CFG and BNFC in the Interpreter. 

There isn't a specific way on how I connect the assignment with the theory other than that the assignment did enlighten me and educate me a lot more on Haskell, CFGs, recursive functions, and parsing. I appreciate the opportunity for hands-on practice, even though there were many bumps in the road along the way. Thank you to Prof. Kurz specifically for allowing me an extension on this assignment.
